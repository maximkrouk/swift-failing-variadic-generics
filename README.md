# swift-failing-variadic-generics

Package with examples of weirdly failing variadic generics ðŸŒš

### Structure
- Package generates separate targets and products for each file
- Package does not generate test targets for files prefixed with an underscore `_`

#### Notes

- May fail to process the manifest after file changes, adding/removing `./` to/from `path: "./Sources")` should help spm to rebuild the manifest

### Comments
- Use of Xcode right sidebar is recommended for reading doc comments
- Search for `âœ…` to find whats working
- Search for `ðŸ›‘` to find failures

### Contents
